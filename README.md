# Skin Cancer Classification Using Deep Neural Networks

## Overview
In my quest to find a problem to solve in my closing year at college, I chanced upon an online write up by a reputable newspaper which stated that there were only about 25 certified dermatologists in Ghana as at 2017, which was to serve a population of about 25 million at the time. Really!! I very much intrigued by this news. I imagined how the nation would cope if there was an outbreak of a skin disease, coupled with the lack of medical equipment. As a result I teamed up with a colleague of tackle the problem.
